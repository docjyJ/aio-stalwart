# Stalwart community container for Nextcloud All-in-one

This container is used in [Nextcloud All-in-one](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/stalwart) to provide a mail server.

Compared to a default Stalwart container, this container allows:
- Automatically configures a mail server and *(In progress) tutorials for actions need to be done manually and advanced feature*.
- Compatible with Nextcloud AIO backups.
- *(Planned) Synchronization of Nextcloud and Stalwart accounts.*

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. You will run this container on a server with a static IP address.
2. Make sure than port `25`, `465`, `993`, `4190` and `10003` are not used by another programme. (Use `sudo netstat -tulpn` to list all used ports).
3. You have deployed the [caddy community container](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/caddy) as reverse proxy. (Other solutions are possible, see: [Use your own reverse proxy](#use-your-own-reverse-proxy)).

### Installation

See [how to use community containers](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers#how-to-use-this).

After installation on nextcloud go to `https://mail.$NC_DOMAIN/login` and login with the following credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: get with the command `docker inspect nextcloud-aio-stalwart  | grep STALWART_USER_PASS`

Once connected, add a domain, configure your DNS zone and create your users.

## Advanced configuration

### Use your own reverse proxy

You need to redirect http (or https) traffic from `mail.$NC_DOMAIN` to port `10003` of the `nextcloud-aio-stalwart` container in `http`.

**Then add your own certificate.** See : [Use your own certificate](#use-your-own-certificate)

Example with `Caddyfile` syntax:
```caddyfile
https://mail.{$NC_DOMAIN}:443 {
    reverse_proxy http://{$STALWAER_IP}:10003
}
```

### Use your own certificate

Please add a certificate in volume `nextcloud_aio_caddy` in this path:
- `$VOLUME_ROOT/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/mail.$NC_DOMAIN/mail.$NC_DOMAIN.key`
- `$VOLUME_ROOT/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/mail.$NC_DOMAIN/mail.$NC_DOMAIN.crt`

If you're using caddy, you can mount the volume `nextcloud_aio_caddy` your caddy container and add this [storage global directive](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#storage):
```caddyfile
{
    storage file_system {$VOLUME_ROOT}/caddy
}
```

## Upgrading
> [!NOTE]
> Unless the starting script tells you, you have no action to do to update.

See https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-server/blob/main/UPGRADING.md

During a major server update, this message will be displayed:

```
Your data is in an old format.
Make a backup and see https://github.com/docjyJ/aio-stalwart#Upgrading
To avoid any loss of data, Stalwart will not launch.
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Before each update don't forget to make a backup.

### Upgrading from 0.7.x to 0.8.x

Run the script [`update_0.7_to_0.8.sh`](https://github.com/docjyJ/aio-stalwart/blob/main/scripts/update_0.7_to_0.8.sh) to update the data.

Please before upgrading, do a backup of your data !

If you're using the root user to run docker, read the script before running it.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docjyJ/aio-stalwart/main/scripts/backup.sh | bash
```
